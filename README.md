# Rock Paper Scissors

## How to play
The game is typically played by two people, although it can be played with more.

Each player makes a choice of either rock, paper, or scissors.

The choices are made simultaneously, so neither player knows what the other will choose.


### The winner is determined according to the following rules
- Rock beats scissors (rock crushes scissors).

- Scissors beats paper (scissors cut paper).

- Paper beats rock (paper covers rock).

If both players choose the same option, then it's a tie and the game is played again.


## Algorithm

1. Start the game with two players.

2. Each player selects an option from rock, paper, or scissors.

3. The options are compared according to the following rules:

4. If one player chooses rock and the other player chooses scissors, then the player who chose rock wins.

5. If one player chooses scissors and the other player chooses paper, then the player who chose scissors wins.

6. If one player chooses paper and the other player chooses rock, then the player who chose paper wins.

7. If both players choose the same option, then it's a tie and the game is played again.

8. Determine the winner and end the game, or if it's a tie, go back to step 2 and play again.

9. Optionally, keep track of the score between multiple games to determine an overall winner.
